# Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project aims to predict stock market prices using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes historical stock data and various machine learning techniques to forecast future prices.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/himanshudash132/Stock_Market_Prediction_ML_1.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd Stock_Market_Prediction_ML_1
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV).
   - Place your dataset in the `data` directory.

2. Train the model:
   - Run the training script:
     ```
     python train.py
     ```

3. Make predictions:
   - Once the model is trained, you can make predictions using the provided scripts or integrate the model into your own applications.

4. Experiment with different algorithms and parameters to improve prediction accuracy.
